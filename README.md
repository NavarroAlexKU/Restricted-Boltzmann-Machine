# Restricted-Boltzmann-Machine
This project implements a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) for collaborative filtering, specifically to build a movie recommendation system. The RBM learns latent features of users and movies from the MovieLens dataset and predicts whether users will like unseen movies.
